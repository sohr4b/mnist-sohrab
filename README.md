This is a demo to show you how to run a handwritten digit recognition model on [Clusterone](https://clusterone.com). The demo uses [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.



Follow the instructions below to run the model on Clusterone using the `just` command line tool. This project is part of Clusterone's [Getting Started guide](https://docs.clusterone.com/docs/get-started). There is also an [in-depth tutorial](https://docs.clusterone.com/docs/mnist-with-clusterone) based on this repository.

***Please note: There is currently a bug in the MNIST example that might affect the performance in distributed  training. We are aware of this and are working on a fix.  This does not affect single node training.***

## Install

To run this project on the Clusterone platform, you need:

- [Python](https://python.org/) 3.5
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- The Clusterone Python library. Install it with `pip install clusterone`
- A Clusterone account. [Sign up](https://clusterone.com/) for free if you don't have an account yet.

### Setting Up

Start out by cloning this repository onto your local machine. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/clusterone/mnist
```

Now you're all set to run MNIST on Clusterone!

## Usage

These instructions use the `just` command line tool. It comes with the Clusterone Python library and is installed automatically with the library.

cd into the folder you just downloaded with `cd mnist`  and log into your Clusterone account using `just login`.

First, create a new project on Clusterone:

```shell
just init project mnist
```

Then, upload the code to the new project:

```shell
git push clusterone master
```

Finally, create a job. Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username.

```shell
just create job distributed --project YOUR_USERNAME/mnist --module mnist --name first-job \
--time-limit 1h
```

Now all that's left to do is starting the job:

```shell
just start job -p mnist/first-job
```

That's it! You can monitor its progress on the command line using `just get events`. More elaborate monitoring is available on the [Matrix](https://clusterone.com/matrix), Clusterone's graphical web interface.

## More Info

For further information on this example, take a look at the tutorial based on this repository in the [Clusterone Documentation](https://docs.clusterone.com/docs/mnist-with-clusterone).
